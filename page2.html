Using CSS it is possible to change the text and background color, font and spacing between paragraphs. You can also create tables, use layout variations, adjust images for their respective screens, and so on. CSS was developed by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996 for a very simple reason. HTML was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You should just write the markup for the site. The relationship between HTML and CSS is quite strong. Since HTML is a markup language (the foundation of a website) and CSS is style-focused (the entire aesthetic of a website), they go together.'],

He created the language while still working at Netscape Communications Corporation, originally created to work in the Netscape Navigator browser, its objective was to facilitate processes within web pages, making the programming of animations and alerts much simpler. Shortly after, about 1 year after its launch, Microsoft started to accept this language in its browser at the time, which was one of the great drivers to consolidate what is Javascript as one of the main programming languages ​​today. Since then, JScript has undergone several different functions and applications, becoming more versatile and complete over time. Today, for example, it is already possible to use Javascript to create Desktop and Mobile applications, not just web-based applications and browsers.'],
